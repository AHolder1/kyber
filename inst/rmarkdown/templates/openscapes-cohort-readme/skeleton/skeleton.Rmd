# `r cr$cohort_name_long`

Welcome to the `r cr$cohort_name_long` Cohort! This is a Cohort for [TODO: who is this cohort for?]. Learn more about Openscapes and the Champions Program: <https://openscapes.org>. 

<img align="right" src="horst-champions-trailhead.png" width="450">  

## Cohort Agendas

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom five times over two months for 1.5 hours each:  

- **Dates:** `r kyber:::pretty_date_sequence(date_range)`
- **Times:** `r kyber:::fmt_duration(cr$time_start, 90)`
- **Location:** remotely, via Zoom

Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our [Cohort Google Drive Folder](`r cr$google_drive_folder`); they are also an archive of our live google-docing. Please see <https://openscapes.org/series> to view blank versions of the agendas. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(schedule)
```

## Co-working times (optional)

Co-working sessions are where we work at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve.

- **Location:** remotely, via Zoom
