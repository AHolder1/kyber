-   **Confirm GitHub access** - if anyone is having problems with access, let us know *before entering your breakout room*.

-   **Breakout groups** (10 min) - Random groups of \~3 [9-10 Rooms] - [ Mentor Name ]

    -   **Prompt: practice editing & committing**
    -   *This breakout group can be less collaborative and more co-working...but please chat and screenshare!*
    -   Link to [our cohort repo](https://github.com/Openscapes/2024-swrcb-fall)
    -   Edit & commit your file, and talk with your breakout group!
        -   Go to our cohort repo, navigate \> github-clinic \> yourname.md
        -   Click on the pencil to edit your file
        -   Make small edits and commit with a commit message
        -   Github.com will give you a default message but get into the habit of writing an actual message to yourself/others (breadcrumbs)
        -   Committing is different from saving (cancel if you save!)
