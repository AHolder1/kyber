- **Inclusion Tip of the Day** (1 min) – Julie
  - However, there is a phenomenon that allies should look out for: Showboating. It’s when an attendee asks off-topic questions during a presentation to make themselves look smart. By doing so, they test the presenter, perhaps undermining their credibility. It’s a power play that’s been used for years, forcing someone in a position of authority at the beginning of the meeting to start defending their expertise.

The next time someone interrupts a speaker and asks an off-topic question, I’ll offer to start a “parking lot” of topics to be addressed later. Then, with a nod to the speaker, proclaim, “I’ve made a note of that question; You can keep going.”
