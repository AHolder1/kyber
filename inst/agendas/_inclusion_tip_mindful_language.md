- **Inclusion Tip of the Day** (1 min) – Julie
 - Be mindful of words and idioms you use. Move away from language that is racist, sexist, violent, ableist, etc. Example: 
   - Use “main” instead of “master” (GitHub branches, bedrooms)
   - Welcome people to meetings with gender-neutral/gender-inclusive language, like “Hi all/everyone/folks/team” instead of “Hi guys/ladies”
   - Others?
