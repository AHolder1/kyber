    -   **Add alt text to images** (slides, tweets, reports)

    -   BONUS: Check out the [SWAMP Accessible Report Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/139gF37wVtcfOSiFkqK-INSwK7d3lfjuM/view) for additional guidance on how to make documents accessible. Hint: download the template and use it as the foundation for new docs! Delete parts you don't need and use the style settings already set up in the doc. Instructions on how to do this are on page 2.
