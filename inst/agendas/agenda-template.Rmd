## Welcome ‚Ä¢ 10:02-10:15 PT



* **Welcome to Openscapes! üëã **(2 min) ‚Äì Julie
    * We are now recording this meeting
    * Live transcriptions are available.
    * Excited to work with you. And thank you!
    * I‚Äôm Julie Lowndes, Openscapes Founder & Co-Director, NCEAS/UCSB
        * Our team here on this call: 
            * Erin Robinson, Openscapes Co-Director, Metadata Game Changers
            * ...
    * I am grateful I am for the land where I am here in Santa Barbara California and I want to honor the Chumash peoples who have been and continue to be stewards of the lands and waters here.
* **Today‚Äôs goals **(1 min) ‚Äì Julie
    * We'll start working towards a common understanding of the Openscapes mindset and what your pathway forward looks like for your team. 
* **You are all welcome here **(3 min) ‚Äì Julie
* This is a positive learning space where everyone is welcome to ask questions and participate.
* Our Code of Conduct** **([full version](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/))
* Be respectful and value each other‚Äôs ideas, styles and viewpoints.
* Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
* Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
* Be open to learning from others.
* Lead by example and match your actions with your words.
* If you have issues, please direct them to:
  * Julie - [lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu](mailto:lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu)
* Erin - [erin@metadatagamechangers.com](mailto:erin@metadatagamechangers.com) 
* Let‚Äôs name power dynamics. Science is hierarchical, through titles, degrees, institutions‚Ä¶ We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we‚Äôll work to flatten that hierarchy.
* We know there is a range of technical experience ‚Äì by design! We are all here because we want to improve data analysis and stewardship practices, get a sense of new software and approaches, reduce friction when collaborating with others, promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in our work and communities, and develop leadership skills.
* We‚Äôre all imperfect and learning together ‚Äì Openscapes included
* Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
* If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, let‚Äôs talk about it
* The pandemic 
* **Openscapes Overview **(5 min) ‚Äì Julie
* In the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward. Through the Champions program we will help you explore and navigate pathways with your team ‚Äì and help the whole cohort become champions and stewards as you become more familiar, confident, and work together.
