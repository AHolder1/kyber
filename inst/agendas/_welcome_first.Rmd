  - Science is hierarchical, through titles, degrees, institutions‚Ä¶ We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we‚Äôll work to flatten that hierarchy.
  - We know there is a range of technical experience ‚Äì by design! We are all here because we want to improve our work around data-intensive science, get a sense of new software and approaches, reduce friction when collaborating with others, promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in our work and communities, and develop leadership skills.
  - We‚Äôre all imperfect and learning together ‚Äì Openscapes included
    - Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
    - If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, let‚Äôs talk about it
  - The pandemic 

- **Openscapes Overview** (5 min) ‚Äì Julie
- In the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward. Through the Champions program we will help you explore and navigate pathways with your team ‚Äì and help the whole cohort become champions and stewards as you become more familiar, confident, and work together.
