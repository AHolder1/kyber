-   **Champions Program [POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/)** (5 min) -- Julie

- We've covered a lot today; we'll explore these ideas more deeply together
  -   **Purpose**
    -   Reimagine data analysis and stewardship, develop modern skills and habits that are of immediate value to you, cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities
  -   **Outcomes**
    -   Different for everybody - this is about reflecting on what you need and developing a practice and allies to help you make progress
    -   You\'ll share your work-in-progress Pathway on our last Cohort Call
  -   **Process**
    -   Opportunities for connecting and support within and across our Cohort. There is so much experience and expertise here
    -   Cohort Calls: Twice-monthly with full Cohort
    -   Seaside Chats: we\'ll provide task suggestions but main purpose is to build the habit of strengthening shared workflows with your broader group.
    -   Co-working: (optional); come to focus on something workflow related - could be quiet work, feedback/questions/problem-solving.
    -   Google Space: asynchronous within Cohort
    -   Slack: asynchronous across Cohorts (present and past)
    - Twitter: asynchronous across open science ([#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query), [\@openscapes](https://twitter.com/openscapes))

-   **Task for next time** (2 min) -- All

    -   **Have a Seaside Chat & start your Pathway**
    -   Start discussing your trailhead: where are you now?\
    -   To structure your thoughts, you can use the Pathways Sheet
        -   Create a copy of [Pathways Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmhOly87OYrPOUqTzmccYbPrTlGmXGsN06GI1FKzxag/edit#gid=0) (File \> Make a copy \> in our shared folder). Focus on the "now" column. Are there rows to add?
    -   **Create GitHub usernames**
        -   Optional advice: <https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html>
        -   Share your GitHub username before next time in our ParticipantsList (in our Cohort Folder, linked from the top of this doc)
    -   **Join Slack** (we'll invite you to our Openscapes org)
        -   Introduce yourself and tag your team
            -   Private channel for our cohort as you get comfortable
            -   New to Slack? [quickstart doc](https://zenodo.org/record/3763730#.YIxK6-tlDUI)
