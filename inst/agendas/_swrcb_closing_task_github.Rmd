        -   *Focus on where you want to go! What would your teams/workflows look like if you had all the resources, time, and tech you needed?*

            -   We recommend adding a "Future Us" column after the "Next Steps" column and writing down where you want "Future You" to be. Don't worry about how you'll get there just yet - just write down all of your goals/dreams without regard to how big or small they might be!
