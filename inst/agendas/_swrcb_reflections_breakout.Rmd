## Reflections • `r kyber:::fmt_duration(params$start_time, params$duration)`

One rapid round of breakout groups. This is your time. Reflect on what you’ve learned, say things out loud, meet your colleagues.

*Need help? Come to the Main Room; We will be there.*\
*You’ll get a 60-sec notification before breakout rooms close.*

**Breakout groups** (10 min) - Random groups of \~3 [9-10 Rooms] - [ Mentor Name ]

-   **Prompt**: Share about your Seaside Chat – Are there questions you have or ideas you want to follow up on or learn?

-   **Discussion / Share-outs** (10 min) – Anna

    Note: Seaside Chats & the Pathway have a basic structure, but the time & space is for your team to adapt these tools for your best/most needed use. We don’t want you to make a Pathway for Openscapes; rather, we want you to make a Pathway that best suits your team's needs (i.e. Future YOU!).

    **Write or say something you heard that resonated with you during the breakout!**
