## Growth Mindset & GitHub for Publishing •

* **Intro to GitHub, edits & publishing** ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PzGAbEpNhT6CDPe1DCHf5-eVAjy-2R2D3VMHz7dY774/edit?usp=sharing) 1-12) (17 min) – Julie

* **Breakout groups: practice editing & committing** (10 min) –  Erin (breakout random groups of 3)
* *This first breakout group can be less collaborative and more co-working...but please chat and screenshare!*

  - Edit & commit your file, and talk with your breakout group!
    - Go to [github.com/openscapes/](https://github.com/openscapes/demo)our-cohort > github-clinic > yourname.md
    - Click on the pencil to edit your file
    - Make small edits and commit with a commit message
    - Github.com will give you a default message but get into the habit of writing an actual message to yourself/others (breadcrumbs)
    - This is different from saving (cancel if you save!)
  - Learn anything cool? Share!
