-   **Inclusion Tip of the Day** (2 min) – Anna
    -   Strive for gender-inclusive language in the workplace
    -   Examples:
        -   Welcome people to meetings/events with gender-neutral/gender-inclusive language, like “Hi all/everyone/folks/team” instead of “Hi guys/ladies” - [Idealist.org](https://www.idealist.org/en/careers/inclusive-language-workplace)
        -   When thinking about how to explain a techinical or complex concept in simple terms - replace thinking of explaining it to "mom" or "grandpa" with dentist or a different gender neutral term for someone we see as capable but whose knowledge is simply outside the tech domain.
